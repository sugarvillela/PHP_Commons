# PHP_Commons
Things I found while cleaning out my closet...

## BitStore Class with test function
* Handy class if you have a bunch of boolean flags to set and you don't want
to use up space.

## QGen Class with test function
* Generates mySQL queries from associative array parameters.

## Commons
* Functions for format, display etc.
* TMath Class: static functions for time
